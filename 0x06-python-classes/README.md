# Python - Classes and Objects

This repository contains a series of Python scripts that demonstrate the concept of classes and objects.
Each script focuses on implementing a class called Square with different functionalities.

## Files

**0-square.py:** This script defines an empty class **Square**.

**1-square.py:** This script defines the Square class and initializes a new square with a given size.

**2-square.py:** This script enhances the Square class by validating the size input and raising appropriate errors if necessary.

**3-square.py:** This script extends the Square class by adding a method to calculate and return the area of the square.

**4-square.py:** This script improves the Square class by implementing a property and setter method for the size attribute, ensuring proper encapsulation and validation.

**5-square.py:** This script further enhances the Square class by adding a method to print a square of # characters with the specified size.

**6-square.py:** This script adds a new attribute called position to the Square class, allowing the square to be printed at a specific position.

## Usage

To use these scripts, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

-Copy code
`$ git clone https://github.com/zuriel0001/0x06-python-classes.git`

-Change to the repository directory:

Copy code
`$ cd 0x06-python-classes`

Run any script using Python:
change directory to **test**

**Copy code**

Each script can be executed by running the corresponding **main.py** file located in the **test** directory.

For example, to use **0-square.py**, module,

copy **0-main.py** to the **0x06-python-classes** directory

using `cp 0-main.py ../` and

run `./0-main.py`
